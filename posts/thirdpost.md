This is my new blog. Unlike the old one, it's not running WordPress any more. Instead, I am experimenting to see if I can construct an easy-to-use website that is also ridiculously fast -- as well as being completely **free** to run, maintain, and secure.

It must also support unlimited amounts of traffic with instantly scalable resources.

More details will undoubtedly be revealed in future blog posts ... just as soon as I figure out what they are.
